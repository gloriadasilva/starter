## Legacy Rate Limit

As of December 16, 2019, the original API rate limiting (40 requests per second) has been disabled. Please, if you need more information about this, check our [API support forum.](https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/category/5047958519c29526b50017d6)

Although the legacy rate limit has been disabled, we still have some upper rate limits that help to prevent flooding the API with too many requests. The rate limit is around the 50 requests per second range.



<Note>
  This limit can change any time, so you need to respect the service we have built to avoid getting an `Error 429`
