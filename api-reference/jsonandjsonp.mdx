The only response format we support is JSON.

If you are using a JavaScript library and need to make requests from another public domain, you can use the `callback` paramater which will encapsulate the JSON response in a JavaScript function for you.



```http
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?query=Batman&callback=test' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```
