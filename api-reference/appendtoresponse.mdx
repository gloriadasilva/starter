`append_to_response`provides an easier way to add extra requests to any top-level namespace. The movie, TV show, TV season, TV episode, and person detail methods all support a query parameter called.`append_to_response`

This allows you to make sub requests within the same namespace in a single HTTP request. Each request will get appended to the response as a new JSON object.

Here's a quick example: let's assume you want the movie details and the videos for a movie. Usually you would think you have to issue two requests:

```http
curl --request GET 
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/11' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN'curl --request GET 
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/11/videos' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN'
```



But with `append_to_response` you can issue a single request:

```http
curl --request GET 
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/11?append_to_response=videos' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN'
```



Even more powerful, you can issue multiple requests, just comma separate the values:

```http
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/11?append_to_response=videos,images' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN'
```

<Note>
  Note

  Each method will still respond to whatever query parameters are supported by each individual request. This is worth pointing out specifically for images since your language parameter will filter images. This is where the `include_image_language` parameter can be useful, as outlined in the [image language](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/image-languages) page.
