There are three main steps involved when creating a `session_id`, they are as follows:





<Steps>

  <Step title = "Step 1">

     **Create a [request token](https://starlight.mintlify.app/api-reference/endpoints/create-request-token)**.

      This is a temporary token that is required to ask the user for permission to access their account. This token will auto expire after 60 minutes if it's not used

   </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2">

     **Ask the user for permission**

      Forward your user to this URL to validate your request token.

      `https://www.themoviedb.org/authenticate/{YOUR_REQUEST_TOKEN}`

     </Step>

   <Step title="Step 3">

     **Create a Session ID**

      Enter your validated request in the Session ID [endpoint](https://starlight.mintlify.app/api-reference/authentication/create-session-id)  token to create yourÂ `session_id`.

     </Step>
