The filter option allows you to filter search results of your request based on specific criteria. It makes it easier to get more specific results.

Some of the supported filter options include:

1. Comma (,): This works just like the 'AND' operator. It allows you to search for two or more objects and will only return results that meet all the specified criteria.

For example, to filter a movie search using these keywords: love, betrayal, happiness will return movies that have these keywords.

1. Piple(|): This works just like the 'OR' operator. It allows you to search for two or more objects and will return results that meet one or all the specified criteria.

For example, to filter a movie search using these keywords: love | betrayal | happiness will return movies with one or all of these keywords.
