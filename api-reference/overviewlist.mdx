There is version 4 (v4) for our list API. It contains several advanced improvements that differentiate it from the version 3 (v3) list. Although v3 lists will continue to work, you can only access these features if you switch to v4 lists.

Some of the new improvements you can access on v4 lists include:

* You can Import "unlimited" items in a single request

* You can use mixed-type (movie and TV) lists

* You can use private lists

* You can add and use comments per item

* There are more sort options

* They are faster

Check the v4 [documentation ](https://developer.themoviedb.org/v4/docs/getting-started)for more information.
