# Capstone Project for the Technical Writing Mentorship Programme (TWMP)

The aim of the capstone project is to gain real-world experience in documenting APIs by revamping the TMDB API documentation.

## What is the TMDB API?

The Movie Database (TMDB) API is a community-driven API that provides extensive access to a wide range of movies, TV shows, images, and actor information. It allows developers to seamlessly integrate these functionalities into their applications.

## Why Revamp the TMDB API Documentation?

The current TMDB API documentation provides comprehensive information on how to use the API. However, there are some inconsistencies, such as improper information architecture and insufficient details on how to retrieve certain parameters.

## The Goal of This Project

The goal of this project is to revamp the TMDB API documentation to ensure it is accurate, comprehensive, clear, and easy for developers to integrate into their applications.

## Tools Used in the Project

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): For documenting endpoints.  
- [OpenAPI Converter](https://kevinswiber.github.io/postman2openapi/): To convert the OpenAPI Specification from JSON to YAML.  
- OpenAPI Specification: A standardized format for describing APIs.  
- Mintlify: An intuitive and interactive platform for documenting APIs.  

## Process Involved

- Documented over 150 endpoints in Postman.  
- Converted the Postman documentation to an OpenAPI Specification using the OpenAPI Converter.  
- Uploaded the OpenAPI Specification to Mintlify.  

## Outcome

An updated version of the TMDB API documentation with the following improvements:

- An intuitive and interactive interface.  
- Clear and concise information about the API.  
- Detailed instructions on how to retrieve required parameters.  
- Improved information architecture.
